Excited to share my latest project - an E-commerce site built using #React.js, #Vite.js, and #TailwindCSS.

Jp·Shop is a fully responsive online store, leveraging the power of React.js, the most in-demand tool for frontend developers. It integrates Vite.js for a fast and lean development environment, TailwindCSS for efficient style management, and React Router DOM for routes and navigation.

Jp·Shop consumes an API to fetch products. Stay tuned for more updates and feel free to check out the repo for more details. #webdevelopment #frontenddevelopment #coding

## upgrade 12/12/23

I am excited to share the latest upgrade of my Jp·Shop project - a responsive E-commerce site built using #React, #Vite.js, and #TailwindCSS.

Jp·Shop has a login feature that allows users to sign in and access additional content such as their account and previous orders. This feature mimics the workflow and functionality of a real login page, but it does not actually authenticate users.

It also has a Skeleton Loading feature that provides a better user experience by showing a loading animation while the content is being fetched. This feature ensures that users are aware that the content is loading and reduces the perceived loading time.

Last but not least, Jp·Shop has a dropdown menu that allows users to easily navigate through different product categories.

Stay tuned for more updates and feel free to check out the repo for more details.
